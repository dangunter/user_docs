<h1>Metabolic Modeling FAQs</h1>

<p>
KBase has a suite of apps, methods, and data that support the reconstruction, prediction, and design of metabolic networks in microbes and plants. These tools could help advance, for example, efforts to optimize microbial production of a certain biofuel, find the minimal media conditions under which that fuel is generated, or predict soil amendments that improve the productivity of plant bioenergy feedstocks.

Below are answers to common questions about KBase’s metabolic modeling tools, including:
<ul>
  <li>What does the KBase gapfilling method do?</li>
  <li>How does the underlying gapfilling algorithm work (i.e., what kind of programming formulation does it use)?</li>
  <li>How do I choose a media condition for gapfilling, and what is the default media used?</li>
  <li>How can I see the compounds comprising a media used in gapfilling?</li>
  <li>When viewing a model, what do the compartment IDs mean?</li>
  <li>How can I download all the biochemical compounds and reactions in KBase?</li>
  <li>Do the media in KBase include sources other than carbon (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur)?</li>
  <li>How can I specify my own media?</li>
  <li>How is media data structured in KBase?</li>
  <li>How can I determine if my metabolic model will grow in a certain media?</li>
  <li>After running flux balance analysis, what does the sign of a reaction flux mean?</li>
  <li>Can I customize the flux boundaries of reactions in my model?</li>
  <li>How can I edit my metabolic model (add or delete reactions, compounds, or biomass)?</li>
  <li>Why did gapfilling fail for a model containing a custom media or custom biomass reaction? What can I do about it?</li>
  <li>What if my source and translated metabolic models are the same after running the “Propagate Genome-scale Model to Close Genome” app?</li>
  <li>What do the “Prediction class” values mean in the output table generated by the “Simulate Growth on Phenotype Data” method?</li>
  <li>Why did I get false negatives after simulating growth, and what can I do about it?</li>
  <li>
